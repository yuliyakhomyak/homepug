                    Pugs often are described as a lot of dog in a small space.
                    These sturdy, compact dogs are a part of the American Kennel Club's 
                    Toy group, and are known as the clowns of the canine world because
                    they have a great sense of humor and like to show off. Originally
                    bred to be a lap dog, the Pug thrives on human companionship.

                <p>The Pug's comical face, with deep wrinkles around big, dark
                eyes and a flat round face, can't help but make you smile. It is
                believed that the Pug's name comes from the Latin word for "fist"
                because his face resembles a human fist.
                </p> 
                <p>Pugs are clowns at heart, but they carry themselves with 
                dignity. Pugs are playful dogs, ready and able for games, but 
                they are also lovers, and must be close to their humans. Pugs 
                love to be the center of attention, and are heartsick if ignored.
                </p>
                <p>Pugs are square and thickset, usually weighing no more than 
                20 pounds. Their heads are large and round, with large, round
                eyes. They have deep and distinct wrinkles on their faces.
                Legend has it that the Chinese, who mastered the breeding of 
                this dog, prized these wrinkles because they resembled good
                luck symbols in their language. Especially prized were dogs
                with wrinkles that seemed to form the letters for the word
                "prince" in Chinese.
